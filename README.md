**Commercial Website for Digital Agency**

I joined this agency in 2022. My team and I developed the first version of a temporary website.
This template was made in 2023 by my Front-End team as well. 

> By particular reasons ($$$) we began produce the website project based on a pre-made template owned by the agency.

The agency management was shit. The administrator was selfish and didn't care about us (devs).
Then, the Back-End wasn't finished and the website was never deployed. I quit the agency in 2023 end.
